== Utopian Tree

The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.

Laura plants a Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter at the onset of spring. How tall will her tree be after n growth cycles?

==== Input Format

The first line contains an integer, t, the number of test cases. 
n subsequent lines each contain an integer, n, denoting the number of cycles for that test case.

==== Constraints

* 1 ≤ t ≤ 10
* 0 ≤ n ≤ 60

==== Output Format

For each test case, print the height of the Utopian Tree after  cycles. Each height must be printed on a new line.

==== Sample Input

==== Sample Output

7 

==== Explanation

There are 3 test cases.

In the first case (n = 0), the initial height (h = 1) of the tree remains unchanged.

In the second case (n = 4), the tree doubles in height and is 2 meters tall after the spring cycle.

In the third case (n = 4), the tree doubles its height in spring (n = 1, h = 2), then grows a meter in summer (n = 2, h = 3), then doubles after the next spring (n = 3, h = 6), and grows another meter after summer (n = 4, h = 7). Thus, at the end of 4 cycles, its height is 7 meters.
