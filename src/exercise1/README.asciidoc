John works at a clothing store. He has a large pile of socks that he must pair them by colour for sale.

You will be given an array of integers representing the colour of each sock. Determine how many pairs of socks with matching colours there are.

John works at a clothing store and he's going through a pile of socks to find the number of matching pairs. More specifically, he has a pile of  n loose socks where each sock i is labelled with an integer, c~i~, denoting its colour. He wants to sell as many socks as possible, but his customers will only buy them in matching pairs. Two socks, i and j, are a single matching pair if they have the same colour (c~i~ = c~j~).

Given n and the colour of each sock, how many pairs of socks can John sell?
