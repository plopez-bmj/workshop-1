== Funny String

In this challenge, you will determine whether a string is funny or not. To determine whether a string is funny, create a copy of the string in reverse e.g. abc -> cba. Iterating through each string, compare the absolute difference in the ascii values of the characters at positions 0 and 1, 1 and 2 and so on to the end. If the list of absolute differences is the same for both strings, they are funny.

Note: The absolute value of x, is written as |x|.

==== Input Format

The first line contains an integer t, (the number of test cases). 
The next t lines contain a string, s.

==== Constraints

* 1 ≤ t ≤ 10
* 2 ≤ length of s ≤ 10000

==== Output Format

For each string s print whether it is *Funny* or *Not Funny* on a new line.

==== Sample Input

2 +
acxz +
bcxz

==== Sample Output

Funny +
Not Funny

==== Explanation

You can use r to store the reverse of s.

Test Case 0: s = "acxz" r = "zxca"

----
  s            r
|c-a| = 2  = |x-z|	 	
|x-c| = 21 = |c-x|	 
|z-x| = 2  = |a-c|
----

Each comparison is equal so we print *Funny*.

Test Case 1: s = "bcxz" r = "zxcb"

----
  s            r
|c-b| = 1 != |x-z| = 2
----

At this point, we stop evaluating s and print *Not Funny*.
